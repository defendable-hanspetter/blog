Saturday 22 Feb, and Sunday 23 Feb at <a
href="https://hackeriet.no">Hackeriet</a> in Oslo. This event is community
organized and free.

Oslo NixOS User Group is very excited to invite you to our first 2 day mini
conference. We've invited some great speakers to cover different aspects of the
Nix ecosystem.

Saturday is dedicated to talks on NixOS, NixOps and the Nix language (and pizza
for the ones who stick around to the end!). On Sunday we have a talk on how to
build Docker containers with Nix, and we‚Äôll end the day with a hands on Nix
package workshop.

Please tell us that you're coming by RSVPing on meetup.com:
* <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-NixOS-User-Group/events/267713288/">DAY 1 - Saturday, Feb 22</a>
* <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-NixOS-User-Group/events/268289311/">DAY 2 - Sunday, Feb 23</a>

## SCHEDULE , DAY 1 ###

* **15:00: "The Nix Ecosystem"** - by Elis Hirwing (etu)

  This presentation aims to give a brief overview of what Nix is, how it
  functions and some of its potential uses. Then we will look at NixOS and some
  other tools that is part of what makes the Nix ecosystem great!

* **15:30: "NixOps"** - by Kim Lindberger

  NixOps is a declarative and fully automated deployment system for NixOS. If
  you've been using NixOS as your desktop OS and would like it to be your server
  OS, or have been playing around with the Amazon AWS images and wonder what the
  next step is, this talk is for you.

* **16:00: "Reading Nix expressions"** - by Adam H√∂se (Adisbladis)

  You just installed Nix or NixOS. You have have a configuration.nix,
  default.nix or shell.nix and it just looks like a soup of characters? This
  talk is for you. Nix is not a big language but the syntax is quite foreign to
  the usual language suspects. The goal of this talk is to demystify the
  language. At the end all the viewers should be able to read Nix code and start
  wielding Nix‚Äôs super powers.

* **17:00 until late: Let's eat pizza and hang out! üçï**


## SCHEDULE, DAY 2

* **13:00: "Building Docker containers with Nix"** - by Adam H√∂se (Adisbladis)
  
  So you‚Äôve learnt how to build a Nix package and everything is great. Now we
  need to learn how to ship our packages to production, which nowadays often
  means deploying to a container registry and then running inside of Docker
  and/or Kubernetes. 
  
  This talk will teach you not only how to build seamlessly integrated
  containers using Nix that brings reproducibility and traceability benefits of
  Nix, but also the inner workings of the Nixpkgs `dockerTools` functions.
  Hopefully we‚Äôll also break a few peoples mental model of how Docker actually
  works under the hood.
  
* **14:00 until late: Nix package workshop**

  Do you have some software you want to package for Nix? Bring your laptop and
  your questions, we will try our best to help you!
