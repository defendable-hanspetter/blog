Hackeriet turned 10 years old last December! Time flies when you're busy hacking! To mark this momentous occasion we decided to invite some old friends and new acquaintances to speak at Hackeriet on March 14th (also known as Pi day, a mathematically fortuitous date)!

## Program

**14:00: [A short introduction to Internet Governance](https://www.meetup.com/hackeriet/events/268683282/) by Maja Enes**

The term «Internet Governance» is an expression to define all actors and agencies who govern the Internet. But who are they, and what is this governing power they claim to hold? This session gives a short introduction to the term «Internet Governance», and looks closer at some of the more prominent bodies to see who are involved and how they work, and is it possible for you or me to make an actual difference?

*Maja Enes* has a background in Psychology and social work. She published the book «Internett Internett Internett» in 2019, to give people without a technical background the opportunity to be able to learn how Internet infrastructure works. This book was born out of the frustration Maja struggled with when she, as a newly appointed chair of the Norwegian Chapter of the Internet Society, tried to learn how Internet works. The last 5 years she has been working freelance and writes about things she does at [www.frkenes.no](http://222.frkenes.no/), for example has she written about when she held a small soldering course at Hackeriet in 2015.

**15:00: [Introduction to election security](https://www.meetup.com/hackeriet/events/268853140/) by Patricia Aas**

Free and correct elections are the linchpin of democracy. For a government to be formed based the will of the people, the will of the people must be heard. Across the world election systems are being classified as critical infrastructure, and they face the same concerns as all other fundamental systems in society.

We are building our critical infrastructure from hardware and software built by nations and companies we can’t expect to trust. How can this be dealt with in Election Security, and can those lessons be applied to other critical systems society depends on today?

*Patricia Aas* is a programmer who has worked mostly in C++ and Java. She has spent her career continuously delivering from the same code-base to a large user base. She has worked on two browsers (Opera and Vivaldi), worked as a Java consultant and on embedded telepresence endpoints for Cisco. She is focused on the maintainability and flexibility of software architecture, and how to extend it to provide cutting edge user experiences. Her focus on the end user has led her work more and more toward privacy and security, and she has recently started her own company, TurtleSec, hoping to contribute positively to the infosec and C++ communities. She is also involved in the Include C++ organization hoping to improve diversity and inclusion in the C++ community.

**16:00: [Dark Patterns and the GDPR](https://www.meetup.com/hackeriet/events/268730284/) by Quirin Weinzierl**

Have you ever felt a website tricked you into providing your data? If so, you probably encountered a "Dark Pattern". Service providers use tricks like defaults, countdowns and confusing language to get us to consent against our own interest. Understanding these patterns leads us into exploring how our decisions are shaped by psychological deficiencies, biases and rules of thumb.

The bad news: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is currently unable to stop Dark Patterns.

The good news: It could, if we use it the right way. And we all can help to confront Dark Patterns. In this talk we'll get an idea of how both these things can work.

*Quirin Weinzierl* is a Ph.D. Candidate at University Speyer. He is currently a visiting Ph.D. researcher at the NRCCL/SERI, University of Oslo. At the German Research Institute for Public Administration Speyer Quirin serves as the coordinator of the research cluster “Transformation of the State in the Age of Digitalization”. Quirin studied law at University Munich and Yale Law School. He clerked at the European Court of Human Rights and worked at the German Parliament’s Academic Research Service. He searches for good behaviorally informed regulation and even better randonée-skiing in Norway.

**17:00: [Unlocking closed software with Frida](https://www.meetup.com/hackeriet/events/269090108/) by Ole André Ravnås**

In a world where so much runs on software, and so little of it is open and transparent, what can we do to uncover the truth about what the software actually does? Which files does it open, and who does it talk to?

In this talk, Ole André will show us how Frida can be used to understand software without access to its source code. This is also very helpful even when source code is available due to the sheer complexity of modern software, with layers and layers of code interacting in unknown ways.

*Ole André Ravnås* is a polyglot hacker passionate about reverse-engineering and dynamic instrumentation. He is also the creator and lead developer of Frida, which he's currently building products on top of at NowSecure. Back in the day he was developing video conferencing products at Tandberg/Cisco, and was a developer on the GStreamer project. Once upon a time a die-hard Linux user, he found himself reverse-engineering the proprietary video codec used by Windows Live Messenger for webcam conversations. The result was released as libmimic back in 2005, and this was his gateway drug to the world of reversing.

**18:00: [Interactive serial communication](https://www.meetup.com/hackeriet/events/268831116/) by Øyvind Kolås**

Øyvind Kolås will tell us about his experiences writing his own ANSI/ECMA-48/vt100 engine, and how he (via some dev-fuzzing) stumbled upon this [bug](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git/commit/?id=eb2be1adf92d58bd8f4ca3458eb04da38bf33c2b)

This talk on interactive serial communications might touch upon some of the following terms: baud, baudot, ascii, cp850, latin1, unicode, DEC, rs232, vt100, ANSI/ECMA-48, ansi.sys, telix, RIP, ReGIS, sixels, BBS, terminal emulator, tty, ssh/telnet NAWS, ascii-art, ansi-art, aalib, caca, chafa, tv. If any of this peaks your interest, come on down!

*Øyvind Kolås* is a digital media toolsmith, creating tools and infrastructure to aid creation of his own and others artistic and visual digital media experiments. He is the maintainer and lead developer of GIMPs next generations engine, babl/GEGL - infrastructure libraries where he for the more than the last decade have been working actively on providing high bitdepths, HDR, CMYK and non-destructive editing and capabilities/possibilities to GIMP - and other software. You can read more about Øyvind on his [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/pippin).

**19:00:** [The birthday gathering](https://www.meetup.com/hackeriet/events/qfbdgqybcfbsb/) will continue until morale improves.

Here's to another 0x00001010 years!
