Hackeriet arranged a small conference during 28-30 dec 2022.
With lots of talks, streaming service for those of us who
couldn't attend in person and lots of good conversations
between the attendants.

The recording of most of the talks have been available on
youtube since the conference and will soon be reposted
as individual talks.

The conference couldn't have happened without our sponsors, The NUUG Foundation, Kovert and our volunteers
that donated their time to arrange it.

## Economic transparency

Generally there isn't a lot of talk on the internet around what it costs to arrange conferences.

The lack of transparency is something that we think prevents new persons from attempting
to arrange these sorts of thing, as they might believe there to be a unreasonable risk
connected to arranging.

As a step of combating that, here is a full transparency around what it costed us to
arrange oslohack:22
