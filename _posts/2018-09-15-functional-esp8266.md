# Talk: Functional Embedded Language
  (15 Sept. at Hackeriet, 19:00)

Jonas S Karlsson[1] is a visiting hacker from Hong Kong, and he's been part of
creating hackerspaces in San Fransisco, Sydney, Hong Kong, Shanghai and various
makerfaires.

He will show his implementation[2] of a LISP-based, funny functional programming
language on the ESP8266 $3 wifi computer.

The talk is not a typical functional type-system theorem proving session, but
more about the practical implementation using no-nonsense C, with efficient
memory usage. Including a practical demo.

Hope to see you there.
